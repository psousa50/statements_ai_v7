# Project Progress

## Current Status

The project is in the initial development phase. A steel thread implementation has been completed, demonstrating the core functionality of the system from end to end. This includes a database schema for transactions, a backend API for adding and listing transactions, and a frontend for displaying transactions.

## Completed Tasks

- 2025-05-01: Implemented end-to-end testing with Playwright
  - Created Playwright project structure in e2e/bank-statements-web
  - Implemented API helper functions for test data setup and teardown
  - Created test for TransactionPage that verifies API-created transactions appear in the UI
  - Added robust error handling and test isolation with unique transaction identifiers
  - Created documentation for running and extending the tests

- 2025-04-29: Implemented CI/CD pipeline
  - Created GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
  - Set up containerization with Docker
  - Configured deployment to Fly.io for test and dev environments
  - Configured deployment to Render for production environment
  - Created documentation for CI/CD pipeline

- 2025-04-27: Implemented steel thread with basic transaction functionality
  - Created PostgreSQL database schema for transactions
  - Implemented FastAPI backend with Hexagonal Architecture
  - Implemented React frontend with TypeScript and Vite
  - Set up API client layer and React hooks for business logic
  - Created UI components for displaying and adding transactions

## Pending Tasks

- Implement file upload functionality
- Implement CSV and Excel parsing
- Add transaction categorization
- Implement data visualization
- Add user authentication
- Add export functionality
- Expand end-to-end testing coverage with additional Playwright tests
- Configure GitHub secrets for CI/CD

## Issues

- No known issues at this time
