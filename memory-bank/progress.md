# Project Progress

## Current Status

The project is in active development. We have completed the implementation of the Statement Processing Architecture, which enables the system to process bank statement files (CSV, XLSX), detect their schema, normalize the data, and persist transactions to the database. This builds upon the previously completed steel thread implementation. We have also implemented the separation of file storage and file analysis metadata to improve the architecture.

## Completed Tasks

- 2025-05-04: Implemented separation of UploadedFile and FileAnalysisMetadata tables
  - Created new domain models for UploadedFile (raw file content) and FileAnalysisMetadata (analysis data)
  - Implemented repository interfaces and implementations for both models
  - Updated StatementAnalyzerService to save only to UploadedFile table and check FileAnalysisMetadata by hash
  - Updated StatementPersistenceService to retrieve file content from UploadedFile and save metadata to FileAnalysisMetadata
  - Added database migration for the new tables
  - Updated dependency injection configuration
  - Fixed all tests to work with the new architecture
  - Ensured all tests pass, confirming the implementation works as expected

- 2025-05-04: Implemented Statement Processing Architecture
  - Created StatementFileTypeDetector for detecting CSV and XLSX files
  - Implemented StatementParser for parsing file content into DataFrames
  - Developed SchemaDetector with LLM integration for detecting column mappings
  - Built TransactionNormalizer for standardizing transaction data
  - Implemented StatementAnalyzerService for file analysis and deduplication
  - Created StatementPersistenceService for saving transactions to the database
  - Wrote comprehensive tests for all components following TDD principles
  - Ensured adherence to project guidelines (no comments/docstrings, clear naming)

- 2025-05-01: Implemented end-to-end testing with Playwright
  - Created Playwright project structure in e2e/bank-statements-web
  - Implemented API helper functions for test data setup and teardown
  - Created test for TransactionPage that verifies API-created transactions appear in the UI
  - Added robust error handling and test isolation with unique transaction identifiers
  - Created documentation for running and extending the tests

- 2025-04-29: Implemented CI/CD pipeline
  - Created GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
  - Set up containerization with Docker
  - Configured deployment to Fly.io for test and dev environments
  - Configured deployment to Render for production environment
  - Created documentation for CI/CD pipeline

- 2025-04-27: Implemented steel thread with basic transaction functionality
  - Created PostgreSQL database schema for transactions
  - Implemented FastAPI backend with Hexagonal Architecture
  - Implemented React frontend with TypeScript and Vite
  - Set up API client layer and React hooks for business logic
  - Created UI components for displaying and adding transactions

## Pending Tasks

- Integrate the Statement Processing Architecture with API endpoints
- Implement file upload UI in the frontend
- Add transaction categorization
- Implement data visualization
- Add user authentication
- Add export functionality
- Expand end-to-end testing coverage with additional Playwright tests
- Configure GitHub secrets for CI/CD

## Issues

- No known issues at this time
