# Project Progress

## Current Status

The project is in active development. We have completed the implementation of transaction categorization and file upload UI, building upon the previously implemented Statement Processing Architecture. The system now allows users to upload bank statement files through an intuitive UI, process them using the Statement Processing Architecture, and categorize transactions using a hierarchical category system. The separation of file storage and file analysis metadata has improved the system architecture and performance.

## Completed Tasks

- 2025-05-19: Implemented transaction categorization system
  - Created Category domain model with hierarchical structure (parent-child relationships)
  - Implemented CategoryRepository interface and implementation
  - Created CategoryService for managing categories (CRUD operations)
  - Implemented TransactionCategorizer interface for categorizing transactions
  - Created TransactionCategorizationService for batch processing of uncategorized transactions
  - Added API endpoint for triggering batch categorization
  - Added database migration for the categories table
  - Created comprehensive tests for all categorization components
  - Ensured adherence to project guidelines (no comments/docstrings, clear naming)

- 2025-05-15: Implemented file upload UI in the frontend
  - Created Upload page with multi-step workflow
  - Implemented FileUploadZone component with drag-and-drop functionality
  - Added ColumnMappingTable for customizing column mappings
  - Created SourceSelector for selecting the bank/source of statements
  - Added validation messages to guide users through the upload process
  - Implemented AnalysisSummary to show file analysis results
  - Created UploadFooter with finalize and cancel actions
  - Added navigation to transactions page after successful upload
  - Integrated with the backend Statement Processing Architecture
  - Created comprehensive tests for all components

- 2025-05-04: Implemented separation of UploadedFile and FileAnalysisMetadata tables
  - Created new domain models for UploadedFile (raw file content) and FileAnalysisMetadata (analysis data)
  - Implemented repository interfaces and implementations for both models
  - Updated StatementAnalyzerService to save only to UploadedFile table and check FileAnalysisMetadata by hash
  - Updated StatementPersistenceService to retrieve file content from UploadedFile and save metadata to FileAnalysisMetadata
  - Added database migration for the new tables
  - Updated dependency injection configuration
  - Fixed all tests to work with the new architecture
  - Updated datetime handling to use timezone-aware methods (datetime.now(timezone.utc)) instead of deprecated datetime.utcnow())
  - Ensured all tests pass without warnings, confirming the implementation works as expected

- 2025-05-04: Implemented Statement Processing Architecture
  - Created StatementFileTypeDetector for detecting CSV and XLSX files
  - Implemented StatementParser for parsing file content into DataFrames
  - Developed SchemaDetector with LLM integration for detecting column mappings
  - Built TransactionNormalizer for standardizing transaction data
  - Implemented StatementAnalyzerService for file analysis and deduplication
  - Created StatementPersistenceService for saving transactions to the database
  - Wrote comprehensive tests for all components following TDD principles
  - Ensured adherence to project guidelines (no comments/docstrings, clear naming)

- 2025-05-01: Implemented end-to-end testing with Playwright
  - Created Playwright project structure in e2e/bank-statements-web
  - Implemented API helper functions for test data setup and teardown
  - Created test for TransactionPage that verifies API-created transactions appear in the UI
  - Added robust error handling and test isolation with unique transaction identifiers
  - Created documentation for running and extending the tests

- 2025-04-29: Implemented CI/CD pipeline
  - Created GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
  - Set up containerization with Docker
  - Configured deployment to Fly.io for test and dev environments
  - Configured deployment to Render for production environment
  - Created documentation for CI/CD pipeline

- 2025-04-27: Implemented steel thread with basic transaction functionality
  - Created PostgreSQL database schema for transactions
  - Implemented FastAPI backend with Hexagonal Architecture
  - Implemented React frontend with TypeScript and Vite
  - Set up API client layer and React hooks for business logic
  - Created UI components for displaying and adding transactions

## Pending Tasks

- Implement data visualization (charts and reports)
- Add user authentication
- Add export functionality
- Implement automatic categorization using machine learning
- Add transaction search and filtering
- Create dashboard with financial insights
- Expand end-to-end testing coverage with additional Playwright tests
- Configure GitHub secrets for CI/CD

## Issues

- No known issues at this time
