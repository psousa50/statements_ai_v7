# Technical Design â€“ Development Phase

Analyse the development plan in InProgress.md and follow the instructions:

1. Follow existing code conventions and patterns.

2. Maintain consistent naming and structure.

3. Implement feature step by step, component by component, including corresponding tests.

   - Generate only the code specified in the approved plan (no extra inferred functionality).
   - Run tests and linter after each component

4. After implementation, run through the verification checklist:
   - List each task from the implementation plan
   - Confirm implementation status of each task
   - Confirm that most functionality is covered by tests
   - Note any assumptions or decisions made
   - Run tests and linter after each component
