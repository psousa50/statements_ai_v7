# Development workflow

You must follow this process step-by-step. **Do not skip, merge, or anticipate steps** unless explicitly approved.

1. Divide the feature into small, manageable components if necessary.
2. Describe each component in detail.
3. Implement the feature step by step, component by component.
4. Start with the bottom (lowest-level) component and work your way up.
5. For each component, write the test first.
6. Implement the **minimum code** needed to make the test **compile**, but **not pass**.
7. Run the test and show the output to prove the test fails as expected.
8. Ask if I agree with the test.
9. If I agree, write the code to make the test pass.
10. If I do not agree, ask me to clarify the test.
11. If I clarify the test, update the test and write the code to make it pass.
