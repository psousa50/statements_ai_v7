# Memory Bank

I am an Agent, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files (./docs/memory-bank/) at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

flowchart TD
    PB[PRD.md] --> DT[DataModel.md]
    PB --> TS[TechStack.md]
    TS --> PJ[ProjectStructure.md]
    PB --> AC[APIContracts.md]
    
### Core Files (Required)
1. `PRD.md`
- Complete Product Requirements Document
- Defines product vision, users, problem statement
- Lists features, success metrics, and MVP boundaries
- Includes functional and non-functional requirements
  
2. `DataModel.md`
- Describes entities and attributes used in the system
- Includes a visual ER diagram (Mermaid syntax)
- Clarifies relationships and business logic assumptions
  
3. `TechStack.md`
- Maps technology choices for frontend, backend, DB, and infrastructure

4. `ProjectStructure.md`
- Guidelines for Backend/Frontend Structure

5. `APIContracts.md`
- Full REST API specification covering CRUD operations
- Includes sample request/response for each route
- Organized by resource group for clarity
- Reflects final data model and authentication logic
