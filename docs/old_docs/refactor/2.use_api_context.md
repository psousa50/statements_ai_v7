Use API context to inject api client

- Create an api client that should contain a collection of interfaces for each resource (transactions, categories, etc.)
- Create a React context to provide the api client to the app
- Use the api client in the hooks

For tests

- use an apiclient function builder that default all methods to return a mock response
- This function should allow to override the default response for specific methods
- wrap the api client in a context provider
- provide the api client in the tests
