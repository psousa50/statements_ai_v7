# Feature Development Process

1 - Implement the feature step by step, components by components.
2 - Start with the bottom component and work your way up to the top component.
3 - For each component, write the test first
4 - Implement the minimum code to make the test compile (not pass)
5 - After writing the minimal code to make the test compile (not pass), you MUST run the test and show the output, proving the test fails as expected
6 - Ask me if I agree with the test.
7 - If I agree, write the code to make the test pass.
8 - If I don't agree, ask me to clarify the test.
9 - If I clarify the test, write the code to make the test pass.
