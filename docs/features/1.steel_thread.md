# Steel Thread

I want to start this project with a steel thread.

Features:

- A database with a table for transactions
- A backend API to add and list transactions
- A frontend to show the transactions

The steel thread should be a minimal implementation of the system, but it should apply the same design patterns and principles that will be used in the final product. It should be a complete end-to-end implementation of a small part of the system, demonstrating how the components will work together. It should contain a simple user interface to view all the transactions.

The steel thread should be deployable and runnable, using the same tools and processes that will be used in the final product.
