- [ ] Create `TransactionProcessor` that:
  - Normalizes all transaction descriptions
  - Extracts unique normalized descriptions
  - Calls rule-based categorization first
  - Calls LLM categorization for remaining items

  - Returns fully processed transactions with categories
- [ ] Handle conflicts when LLM returns different categories for same description
- [ ] Comprehensive logging of processing stages
- [ ] Progress tracking for large uploads
- [ ] Rollback capability on processing failures

### Technical Notes:
- Consider using database transactions for atomicity
- Implement idempotency for retries
- Add metrics for monitoring processing performance

## Story 6: Statement Upload API Endpoint

**As a** user  
**I want** to upload a financial statement file  
**So that** my transactions are imported and categorized automatically

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create `POST /api/statements/upload` endpoint
- [ ] Support common file formats (CSV, OFX, QIF)
- [ ] File validation and size limits
- [ ] Parse transactions from uploaded file
- [ ] Trigger transaction processing pipeline
- [ ] Return upload status and processing job ID
- [ ] Handle file parsing errors gracefully

### Technical Notes:
- Use multipart/form-data for file uploads
- Consider asynchronous processing for large files
- Store original file for audit purposes

---

## Story 7: Transaction Processing Status API

**As a** user  
**I want** to check the status of my statement processing  
**So that** I know when categorization is complete and can view results

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create `GET /api/processing/{jobId}/status` endpoint
- [ ] Return processing status: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED
- [ ] Include progress information (processed/total transactions)
