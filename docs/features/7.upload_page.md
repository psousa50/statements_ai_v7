# UX Design and Build Plan for Statement Upload Page

---

### 📊 Objective

Create a clear, functional, and visually beautiful UI for users to upload bank statements, review extracted data, adjust settings, and finalize the upload.

---

### 🔹 Features & Flow

#### 1. **Upload Section**

* Drag-and-drop file area
* Button to browse local files
* Shows file type and size limit (e.g., CSV, XLSX, max 10MB)
* After selection: show a loading spinner and send the file to the backend for analysis

#### 2. **Analysis Summary (Returned from Backend)**

* Detected source (e.g., bank name or format)
* Number of rows
* Total amount (sum of "Amount" column)
* Date range (if available)
* First few rows of data as preview (up to 10)

#### 3. **Editable Column Mapping Table**

* Table with header row and 10 preview rows
* Each column has a dropdown above it to set column type:

  * Description
  * Amount
  * Date
  * Category (optional)
  * Ignore
* Show which row is treated as the header
* Allow user to set start of data row if parsing was incorrect

#### 4. **Validation & Warnings**

* Ensure required columns (Amount, Date) are mapped
* Highlight if values seem off (e.g., blank cells, unusual values)
* Help icons or tooltips to explain each column type

#### 5. **Final Actions**

* "Finalize Upload" button (disabled until valid mappings)
* Optional: "Cancel" or "Start Over"
* Optional: "Save Mapping as Template"
