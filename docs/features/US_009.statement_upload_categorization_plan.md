# Full Statement Upload & Transaction Categorization Plan

## Goal
To process a list of uploaded transactions and categorize them using a combination of database rule matching and an LLM-based categorization service. Categorized transactions will be saved with the assigned category; uncategorized ones will be saved with a special status.

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Normalize Descriptions
- Normalize the `description` field for each transaction using a common function.
- Example normalization steps:
  - Lowercase
  - Remove punctuation
  - Remove digits
  - Trim whitespace

### 2. Build List of Unique Normalized Descriptions
- Extract all **distinct** normalized descriptions from the transactions.
- Create an intermediate list structure:
  ```json
  [
    { "normalized_description": "spotify", "category_id": null },
    { "normalized_description": "uber", "category_id": null },
    ...
  ]
  ```

---

## Phase 1: Rule-Based Categorization (Database)

### 3. Batch Processing
- Break the list of unique normalized descriptions into batches (e.g. size 100).
- For each batch:
  - Query the `transaction_categorization` table:
    ```sql
    SELECT normalized_description, category_id
    FROM transaction_categorization
    WHERE normalized_description IN (...)
    ```
  - Update the batch items in memory with matched `category_id`.

### 4. Apply Categorization from DB
- Use the updated list to assign categories to the original transactions:
  - Match each transactionâ€™s normalized description.
  - If a match is found with a `category_id`, mark the transaction as `CATEGORIZED`.

---

## Phase 2: AI-Based Categorization (LLM)

### 5. Identify Remaining Unmatched Transactions
- From the original transaction list, collect all those that remain uncategorized.

### 6. Batch AI Categorization
- Send remaining uncategorized transactions in batches to the **LLM Transaction Categorization Service**.
- Receive response with predicted category IDs:
  ```json
  [
    { "normalized_description": "spotify", "category_id": "uuid-123", "confidence": 0.97 },
    ...
  ]
  ```

### 7. Update Categorization Table with AI Results
- Group LLM results by normalized description.
- If all category_ids for the same description are the same:
  - Insert into `transaction_categorization` table.
- If multiple different categories are returned for the same description:
  - Skip the insertion for that normalized description (log the conflict).

---

## Final Step: Save Transactions

### 8. Save All Transactions to DB
- Save all transactions to the database.
  - Transactions that were categorized receive their assigned `category_id` and `CATEGORIZED` status.
  - Others are saved with `UNCATEGORIZED` status.

---

## Notes

- Ensure the `transaction_categorization` table has a unique constraint on `normalized_description`.
- Optionally log all updates to that table with a `source = 'AI'` and a `confidence` value.
- The batch size can be tuned independently for DB queries and LLM requests.
