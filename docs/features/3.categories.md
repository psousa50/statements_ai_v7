# Categories

We need to add Categories to the transactions.
Categories will have only two levels:

- Category
- Subcategory

The categories will be hierarchical, meaning that a subcategory belongs to a category.
The categories will be stored in a separate table in the database
Ther will be only one Category table. It contains a (nullable) field for the parent category id.

Each transaction will have a foreign key to the category (a SubCategory in fact) it belongs to.
The category of an transation can be null, if not specified.
Each transaction will have a categorization status field, which cab be "uncategorized", "categorized" or "failure".
The categorization status will be set to "uncategorized" when the transaction is created if the category is null.

Change everything in the codebase to use the new categorization system.
