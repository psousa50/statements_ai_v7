# FastAPI Dependency Injection Design Pattern with External and Internal Dependencies

This document outlines a clean and testable dependency injection pattern for FastAPI applications, separating **external dependencies** (e.g., database clients, Kafka producers) from **internal dependencies** (e.g., services, repositories). This approach makes the system easier to test, modularize, and configure for different environments.

---

## Goals

- ✅ Clearly separate I/O-heavy dependencies from business logic
- ✅ Enable easy mocking of services in tests without monkeypatching
- ✅ Support different configurations (test, dev, prod)
- ✅ Promote clean architecture and maintainability

---

## Terminology

- **ExternalDependencies**: Components that talk to the outside world (databases, queues, APIs).
- **InternalDependencies**: Business logic components that orchestrate behavior (services, repositories) and depend on external ones.

---

## Dependency Injection via App Setup

Instead of hardcoding dependencies using `Depends(...)` in your route functions, inject **internal dependencies** into the app, and construct them from external ones in a controlled initialization step.

---

## Step-by-Step Design

### 1. Define dependency containers

```python
class ExternalDependencies:
    def __init__(self, db: Session, kafka_producer: KafkaProducer):
        self.db = db
        self.kafka_producer = kafka_producer


class InternalDependencies:
    def __init__(self, transaction_service: TransactionService):
        self.transaction_service = transaction_service
```

### 2. Build dependencies in a central place

```python
def build_external_dependencies() -> ExternalDependencies:
    db = create_db_session()
    kafka = KafkaProducer(...)
    return ExternalDependencies(db=db, kafka_producer=kafka)

def build_internal_dependencies(external: ExternalDependencies) -> InternalDependencies:
    transaction_repo = SQLAlchemyTransactionRepository(external.db)
    transaction_service = TransactionService(transaction_repo)
    return InternalDependencies(transaction_service=transaction_service)
```

### 3. Register routes with internal dependencies

```python
def register_transaction_routes(app: FastAPI, internal: InternalDependencies):
    @app.post("/transactions")
    def create_transaction(data: TransactionCreate):
        return internal.transaction_service.create_transaction(data)
```

> ✅ Note: We do **not** pass external dependencies into the app — they are only used to construct the internal dependencies before route registration.

---

## Example: App Setup

```python
app = FastAPI()
external = build_external_dependencies()
internal = build_internal_dependencies(external)
register_transaction_routes(app, internal)
```

---

## Example: Test Setup

```python
def test_create_transaction():
    mock_service = MagicMock()
    internal = InternalDependencies(transaction_service=mock_service)
    app = FastAPI()
    register_transaction_routes(app, internal)
    client = TestClient(app)

    response = client.post("/transactions", json={...})
    assert response.status_code == 201
```

No monkeypatching. No fragile overrides. Just clean, explicit injection of internal logic.

## Benefits

| Feature                          | Traditional Depends | Container-based DI |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Easy to test                    | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes              |
| Requires monkeypatch            | ✅ Often             | ❌ Never            |
| Modular dependency separation   | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes              |
| Supports environment config     | ⚠️ Limited           | ✅ Fully            |
| Encourages clean architecture   | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes              |

---

## Summary

Split your FastAPI dependencies into two explicit containers:

- `ExternalDependencies` for I/O and infrastructure
- `InternalDependencies` for business logic and orchestration

Use external dependencies only to construct internal dependencies. Then inject only the internal ones into your FastAPI route registration.

This results in strong separation of concerns, testable design, and clean architecture.

This pattern works especially well in:

- Clean/Hexagonal Architecture
- Multi-environment apps
- Apps using Kafka, databases, and third-party APIs
