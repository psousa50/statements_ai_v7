# Technical Design â€“ Development Phase

Using the implementation plan develop the story following these guidelines:

## 1. Preparation

- Read the current implementation plan and task breakdown
- Analyze existing codebase for patterns, conventions, and similar components
- Identify the first task/component to implement

## 2. Development Process

For each component in the plan:

**Code Generation:**

- Follow existing code conventions and patterns found in the codebase
- Maintain consistent naming and structure
- Generate ONLY the code specified in the approved plan
- Include comprehensive tests for each component
- Add clear comments explaining complex logic

**Quality Checks:**

- Ensure code follows project's linting rules
- Verify tests cover main functionality paths
- Check integration with existing components

## 3. Implementation Output

For each component, provide:

- **File path and name**
- **Complete code** (properly formatted)
- **Test files** with comprehensive coverage
- **Brief explanation** of implementation decisions

## 4. Verification Checklist

After completing all components:

- [ ] List each task from implementation plan with status
- [ ] Confirm test coverage for main functionality
- [ ] Document any assumptions or decisions made
- [ ] Note any deviations from original plan (with justification)

**Start with the first component/task from the plan.**
