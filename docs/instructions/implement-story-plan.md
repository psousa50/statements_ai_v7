# Implement a Story plan

- Implement the story plan by following the best practices and guidelines.
- The implemented code should be complettely production-ready, meaning it should be well-tested and follow the coding standards of the project.
- Read `/docs/instructions/testing-strategy.md`` to understand the testing strategy and how to implement tests for the new code.

In the end:

- Review the implementation against the plan
- Ensure all tests described in the test plan are implemented
- Check the code passes all linting checks and builds successfully
- Run ALL tbe tests and ensure they pass
- Fix any warnings or errors that arise during testing
