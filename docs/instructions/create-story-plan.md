# Technical Design â€“ Planning Phase

Please analyze the user story and create a detailed implementation plan:

1. Outline your understanding of:

   - The specific requirements from this story
   - How this feature integrates with existing functionality
   - Any dependencies or prerequisites

2. Perform a codebase analysis focusing on:

   - Integration points for the new feature
   - Reusable components or utilities

3. Provide an implementation plan including:
   - Component/file structure
   - Required changes to existing code
   - New components/modules to be created
   - Tests (as part of the plan)
   - A final, detailed list of tasks to execute (including test tasks)

Finally, ask the user for feedback on this plan before proceeding.
