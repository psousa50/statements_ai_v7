# Technical Design â€“ Planning Phase

Please analyze the user story and create a detailed implementation plan:

## 1. Requirements Analysis

Outline your understanding of:

- The specific requirements from this story
- How this feature integrates with existing functionality  
- Any dependencies or prerequisites
- **Success criteria and acceptance conditions**

## 2. Codebase Analysis

Perform a technical assessment focusing on:

- **Current relevant code structure** (existing files/components that relate)
- Integration points for the new feature
- Reusable components or utilities
- **Potential conflicts or breaking changes**

## 3. Implementation Plan

Provide a detailed plan including:

- **File/component structure** (what goes where)
- Required changes to existing code
- New components/modules to be created
- **Database/API changes** (if applicable)
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e as needed)
- **Estimated complexity/effort** for each task

## 4. Task Breakdown

Create a prioritized, actionable task list:
- [ ] Task 1 with clear deliverable
- [ ] Task 2 with clear deliverable
- etc.

**Before proceeding:** Please review this plan and provide feedback or approval.
