# File Storage Optimization (Completed: 2025-05-04)

**Story**: Implement separation of UploadedFile and FileAnalysisMetadata tables for better performance and architecture.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Create new domain models for UploadedFile and FileAnalysisMetadata
- ✅ Implement repository interfaces and implementations for both models
- ✅ Update StatementAnalyzerService to save only to UploadedFile table and check FileAnalysisMetadata by hash
- ✅ Update StatementPersistenceService to retrieve file content from UploadedFile and save metadata to FileAnalysisMetadata
- ✅ Add database migration for the new tables
- ✅ Update dependency injection configuration
- ✅ Fix all tests to work with the new architecture

**Implementation Details**:
- Created separate tables for raw file content and analysis metadata
- Implemented file hashing for deduplication
- Updated datetime handling to use timezone-aware methods
- Ensured all tests pass without warnings
- Improved system architecture and performance
