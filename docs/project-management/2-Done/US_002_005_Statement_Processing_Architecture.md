**Story US-02, US-05**: Implement a comprehensive statement processing architecture for handling various bank statement formats.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Create StatementFileTypeDetector for detecting CSV and XLSX files
- ✅ Implement StatementParser for parsing file content into DataFrames
- ✅ Develop SchemaDetector with LLM integration for detecting column mappings
- ✅ Build TransactionNormalizer for standardizing transaction data
- ✅ Implement StatementAnalyzerService for file analysis and deduplication
- ✅ Create StatementPersistenceService for saving transactions to the database
- ✅ Write comprehensive tests for all components following TDD principles

**Implementation Details**:
