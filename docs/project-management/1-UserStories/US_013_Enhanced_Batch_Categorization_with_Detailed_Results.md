# US-13: Enhanced Batch Categorization with Detailed Results

**As a** system administrator or power user,  
**I want the** categorization system to process multiple transactions efficiently and provide detailed results for each transaction,  
**So that** I can track the success and failure of categorization attempts and handle large volumes of transactions effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- System can accept a list of transactions for batch processing
- System returns detailed results for each transaction including:
  - Transaction ID
  - Assigned category ID (if successful)
  - Categorization status (Categorized or Failed)
- System processes transactions efficiently in batch mode
- Failed categorizations include error information
- System maintains transaction order in results
- System handles partial failures gracefully (some succeed, some fail)
- System provides performance improvements over single-transaction processing
- API supports both single and batch categorization modes

**Dependencies:**

- US-10: Manage Categories
- US-11: Categorize Transaction
- US-12: Batch Categorize Transactions
